## My process

I use Vite with react and it was pretty fun building this project, I learned a lot and Vite is a powerful tool when it comes to fast deployment and so on.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - JS library
- [React reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/) - React library


### What I learned

I learned about the onLoad event.

```jsx
<div onLoad={() => { game();}}></div>
```
